# How does ERC721A save gas?

1. Batch Minting
RC721A allows for batch minting of tokens, which significantly reduces the gas cost per token when minting multiple tokens at once. Regardless of the quantity minted, the `_mint` function only performs 3 SSTORE operations.

2. Lazy initialization:
ERC721A only initializes the token ownership of the first token in a batch mint, it defers the initialization of the remaining tokens in the batch to the first transfer.

3. Efficient Storage:
ERC721A optimizes storage by reducing the number of storage writes. It uses a single storage slot to store the ownership data for multiple tokens, which reduces the gas cost associated with storage operations.

4. Cheaper subsequent transfers:

ERC721A allows for cheaper subsequent transfers in comparison to ERC721.



# Where does it add cost?

1. Higher first transfer gas cost:

ERC721A defers the initialization of token ownership slots from minting to transferring resulting in higher first transfer gas costs.

2. Higher total gas cost:

ERC721A results into higher total gas (mint + transfer) costs.
