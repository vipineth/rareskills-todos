# How does ERC721A save gas?

1. Batch Minting
RC721A allows for batch minting of tokens, which significantly reduces the gas cost per token when minting multiple tokens at once.

2. Efficient Storage:
ERC721A optimizes storage by reducing the number of storage writes. It uses a single storage slot to store the ownership data for multiple tokens, which reduces the gas cost associated with storage operations.
