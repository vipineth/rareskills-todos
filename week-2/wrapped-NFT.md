# Besides the examples listed in the code and the reading, what might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?

The wrapped NFT pattern can be used for various purposes, including:

1. **Interoperability**: Wrapped NFTs can enable interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing NFTs to be transferred and utilized across multiple platforms.

2. **Fractional Ownership**: By wrapping an NFT, it can be divided into multiple fungible tokens, enabling fractional ownership and allowing multiple users to own a portion of a valuable NFT.

3. **Enhanced Functionality & Upgradability**: Wrapping an NFT can add additional features, functionalities, metadata or attributes that the original NFT might not support, such as staking, lending, or renting.

4. **Bundling**: Multiple NFTs can be wrapped together into a single token, simplifying the transfer and management of a collection of NFTs.

5. **Access Control**: Wrapped NFTs can be used to grant access to exclusive content, events, or services, acting as a key or membership token.

6. **Collateral for Loans**: NFT holders can use their assets as collateral for loans or to earn yield.

7. **Security**: Wrapping an NFT can add an extra layer of security, protecting the original NFT from known vulnerabilities or exploits.
